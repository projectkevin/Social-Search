SCLSRCH

=============ABOUT

This was a project I did a few years ago in college. It acted as a code-based project to prove a point for a white paper demonstrating the differences between social media search (i.e. community-based search) and "traditional" search akin to Google, Yahoo, etc.

I haven't done much with the code, so ignore the over-zealous comments and archaic structure (i.e. one single, long-form file rather than seperated libraries).


===========SETUP

To use this you will need API access keys from services other than Twitter & Reddit (because they just have an open format return for search API methods). Just fill in the API key format in the URL section in each function once that's done.

Otherwise all you need is a PHP-enabled server setup to run and test this.

I've left CSS etc. there. It's not perfect (I've moved/changed/added/removed bits in the meantime) but it'll do as a demonstration.

Just get in contact with me if you notice any issues.
